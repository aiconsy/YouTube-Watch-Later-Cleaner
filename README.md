## How It Works

The extension uses Chrome's content script API to:

5. **Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time feedback on the cleaning process

## Safety Features

- ‚úÖ **Confirmation Dialogs**: Asks for confirmation before bulk operations
- ‚úÖ **Page Validation**: Only works on the actual Watch Later page
- ‚úÖ **Stop Control**: Ability to halt the process at any time
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues or page changes
- ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting**: Adds delays between removals to avoid overwhelming YouTube's servers

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working?
1. **Check the Page**: Make sure you're on `youtube.com/playlist?list=WL`
2. **Refresh the Page**: Sometimes YouTube's dynamic loading needs a refresh
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the extension has permission to access YouTube
4. **Reload Extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and click the reload button

### Videos Not Being Removed?
1. **Slow Internet**: The extension adds delays, but slow connections might need more time
2. **YouTube Updates**: YouTube occasionally changes their interface; the extension may need updates
3. **Ad Blockers**: Some ad blockers might interfere with the extension

### Error Messages?
- **"Please navigate to your YouTube Watch Later playlist first"**: You're not on the correct page
- **"No videos found to remove"**: Your Watch Later list is already empty
- **"Could not find menu button"**: YouTube's interface may have changed
